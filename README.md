# Diff Application
This is an Java application that compares two texts line by line.
The application receives the paths to two files as input. 
As a result, the file ```diff.html``` is generated. It displays as follows:
- Split View: text from first file on the left, text from second file on the right;
- Inserted line - green background;
- Deleted line - gray background;
- Modified line - blue background.
